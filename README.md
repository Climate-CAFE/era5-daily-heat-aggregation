# era5-daily-heat-aggregation
Using the R ecmwfr package, ERA5 hourly temperature measures are downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. Using temperature and dewpoint temperature, heat index and humidex metrics are derived. Daily mean, maximum, and minimum measures are assessed across administrative boundaries. Kenya is used as a demonstration area.
